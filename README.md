## Challenges & Solutions

Creating a scalable experience for users across multiple carriers required a modular design. We built reusable components to handle different types of documents and carriers dynamically. Ensuring reliability and security in handling sensitive client information was also a priority, so we implemented strict validation and connection handling logic.  

The biggest UX challenge was designing an interface that worked for a wide range of age groups, so we emphasized simplicity, clear language, and responsive layouts across devices.
